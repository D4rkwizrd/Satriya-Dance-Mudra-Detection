# Satriya-Dance-Double-Handed-Mudra-Detection
This project focuses on the application of advanced image processing techniques to facilitate the recognition  of Sattriya dance hand mudras, a significant aspect of the traditional dance form originating from the Indian state of Assam. 
Key Points:
Gesture Recognition in Dance Forms
Making it Accessible: Web App Deployment
Cultural Heritage Digitization
The algorithms which we mainly considered are YOLOv8, RT-DETR and YOLOv5
Building a User-Friendly Interface: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask
Integrated the trained YOLOv8 model with the UI using Flask, a Python web framework.
